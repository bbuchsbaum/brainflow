I looked into this early on in the project but have not returned to
the topic.  It certainly is worthy of some framework support.
Shannon Hickey (the Swing project's technical lead) provided the
following material about handling uncaught exceptions in general.  If
you're
interested in this topic, I think you'll find this all helpful.

The problem really does need to be addressed by the framework.

------------------

I've done some more research on the concept of dealing with uncaught
exceptions in Swing and would like to present the answers. Like you've
discovered with other things recently, there are multiple approaches.
I'll discuss them all below:

1) Calling Toolkit.getSystemEventQueue.push() with a new HandlerQueue()
that deals with uncaught exceptions.

- The benefit of this approach is that it is very clear and is clearly
supported by the current API.

- The downside is that I've spoken with the AWT technical lead and he's
suggested that using EventQueue.push() is deadlock-prone. That is, the
area of code that deals with EventQueues is quite complex and there may
be unknown bugs that could cause deadlocks. If you were to call push()
at the very beginning of your app, and be sure to call System.exit()
rather than wait for auto-shutdown, this approach is probably okay. But
the AWT lead recommends choosing another approach.


2) Using the "sun.awt.exception.handler" system property.

- The benefit is that this does *exactly* what you want and is probably
the easiest to use.

- The downside is that the documentation mentions it will go away in the
future in favor of proper API. That being said, I've discussed it with
the AWT lead and he's confident that there's very little chance of this
ever being removed. When proper API is added, this property will likely
remain.

- Another downside is that this property may be specific to Sun's
implementation as this is a "sun.*" property.

3) A third approach was just brought to my attention and is what our
Swing architect has previously recommended to customers.

java.lang.Thread has a
"setUncaughtExceptionHandler(UncaughtExceptionHandler)" method. Using
this method, you can explicitly set an UncaughtExceptionHandler on the
EDT. I believe the approach is:

// make sure this happens on the EDT
// so we can fetch the EDT with Thread.currentThread()
SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        Thread.currentThread().setUncaughtExceptionHandler(...);
    }
});


Two down sides to this approach, it doesn't work when a modal dialog
is shown, and it won't work in sandboxed applets or apps.


Finally, I'll point out that there is an existing RFE in our system that
proposes to provide proper API for this. If you are members or can
become members of Sun's Developer Network (free to do so), please feel
free to vote for this bug. Or of course, if you sign up for support and
have a channel to escalate this, you can do that to. Here's a link to
the bug report:
